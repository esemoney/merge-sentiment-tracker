# data

⚠️You can delete this file after initializing your project.

This is the **data** folder.
Here, put raw data for your project. You usually won’t sync this to source control, unless you use very small, text-based datasets (< 10 MBs).

To instruct git to not add it to things to sync, add `data` to your **`.gitignore`** file.

Your **`.gitignore`** file contains a list of files that git should ignore.
